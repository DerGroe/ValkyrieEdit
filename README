ValkyrieEdit v0.1

THIS IS A PRELIMINARY VERSION THAT IS ACTIVELY BEING WORKED ON. Please report any issues @ https://github.com/dhavard/ValkyrieEdit/issues

This is a C# program designed to aid modding of Valkyrie Chronicles PC / Steam version. 

It parses the *.mxe files and extracts data in a CSV format, and then optionally, writes it back from the CSV to the *.mxe file... to allow more "sane" editing that sitting in a Hex editor for days.

If you choose to use the pre-built files in the "./Binaries" directory, note that you may not be getting the latest version of the application. Building it yourself will pretty much always be better until final release candidates are compiled.

Run the application with "-help" argument for more information, it should generate output to the console window describing how to use it.
If the -help argument does not work for some reason, you can read a copy of this text in the "./ValkyrieEdit/help.txt" file.

Also, the solution files contain a 'config.txt' which is not automatically deployed (I have an older version of VS) but it is a good starting point to use to place in the same directory as your ValkyrieEdit.exe file.

!!!Note that while the program does allow editing of string values, it does not allow those values to differ in length from the original value!!! (At least not yet).

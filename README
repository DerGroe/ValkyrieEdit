This is a C# program designed to aid modding of Valkyrie Chronicles PC / Steam version.

It parses the *.mxe files and extracts data in a CSV format, and then optionally, writes it back from the CSV to the *.mxe file... to allow more "sane" editing that sitting in a Hex editor for days.

Run the application with "-help" argument for more information.

!!!Note that while the program does allow editing of string values, it does not allow those values to differ in length from the original value!!! (At least not yet).

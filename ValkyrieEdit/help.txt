Version 0.2

This program is designed to read and edit *.mxe files used by the PC version of Valkyrie Chronicles. Requires DotNetFramework 3.5 or higher.
Example call:
   > ValkyrieEdit.exe [Path\To\File\game_info.mxe] [-HILQRST]


All arguments are optional, required information such as file path will either be prompted or defaulted if not supplied.
Mode arguments:
-H : Hex mode. Output all data in hex format
-I : Output the index tables extracted from the *.mxe file in *.csv format.
-L : Output pointer data in hex, as opposed to resolving the pointer to the value to which it points
-Q : Do not output columns/data where the column is not defined by the config.txt file
-R : Read mode [default mode]. Read in the *.mxe file and generate a set of csv files from it. Uses the config.txt file to determine column names and types.
-S : Sync mode. Read in the *.csv files generated by a Read mode execution and write them to the *.mxe file. By default, *-Data.csv files will be read. In Hex mode, *-Hex.csv files will be read. *-OTHER.csv files which are generated for data types not defined by config.txt will never be read to avoid writing 'not-understood' data.
-T : Test mode. Read in the *.csv files generated by a Read mode execution and determine what would be written to the *.mxe file; HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to use this prior to a Sync mode run.


Recommended workflow:
0. !!!!!MAKE A BACKUP OF THE FILE YOU ARE INTERESTED IN!!!!!!
1. Do a read mode execution on the file you are interested in.
  > ValkyrieEdit.exe Path\To\File\game_info.mxe
2. Edit one of the generated *-Data.csv files (or *-Hex.csv for Hex mode) using an editor of your choice. Open Office spreadsheet set to use UTF-8 character set works perfectly.
3. Do a test mode execution on the file you wish to change.
  > ValkyrieEdit.exe Path\To\File\game_info.mxe -T
4. Confirm that console output reports only changing data you really wish to change.
5. Do a sync mode execution on the file you wish to change.
  > ValkyrieEdit.exe Path\To\File\game_info.mxe -s
6. Run the Valkyrie Chronicles game normally and confirm your changes are in place!
7. ^_^ Enjoy ^_^
